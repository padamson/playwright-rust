# Version 1.0: Real-World Validation - Implementation Plan

**Status:** 🚧 **IN PROGRESS**

**Goal:** Validate playwright-rust through real-world usage (Dogfooding Project TBD), address architectural issues discovered, and prepare for v1.0.0 release with single-crate architecture.

**User Story:** As a Rust developer using playwright-rust in production, I want a simple, production-ready library that works correctly as a crates.io dependency, matches official Playwright patterns, and provides comprehensive examples based on real usage.

**Approach:** Feedback-driven development based on v0.6+ usage and real-world integration

**Key Discovery:** Initial integration attempts revealed Issue #3 (build script workspace detection) which exposed fundamental complexity in the two-crate architecture. This drove the decision to consolidate to single-crate architecture (completed in v0.7.0).

---

## Strategic Context

Version 1.0 represents a shift from feature implementation to real-world validation. We will gather feedback from:

1. **Dogfooding Integration** - Direct experience integrating playwright-rust into a real project (Project TBD)
2. **Early Adopters** - Community users trying v0.6.0+
3. **Performance Metrics** - Real-world performance data
4. **Migration Experiences** - Actual challenges when moving from other libraries

This feedback-driven approach ensures we're solving real problems, not theoretical ones.

## Deferred from Version 0.6

### High Priority

1. **Examples and Migration Guide** (Version 0.6 Slice 5)
   - **Why Deferred**: Need real-world usage patterns to create meaningful examples
   - **Will Include**:
     - Advanced examples addressing common use cases discovered through dogfooding
     - Migration guides tackling actual pain points from users switching libraries
     - Getting Started tutorial refined from onboarding experiences
     - Troubleshooting guide based on real issues encountered
   - **Success Metric**: Examples directly address top 5 user pain points

2. **Flaky Test Improvements** (Version 0.6 Slice 7)
   - **Why Deferred**: Require real-world usage to determine if alternative approaches are needed
   - **Items**:
     - `test_no_zombie_processes`: Timing-dependent zombie reaping varies by OS/load. May need different approach to verify process cleanup without timing races.
     - `test_error_recovery_stress`: Rapid navigation success rate varies by CI environment. Consider alternative stress test that doesn't depend on navigation success rates.
   - **Context**: Both tests verify important properties but can't guarantee 100% CI reliability due to environmental variance. Currently marked `#[ignore]` but available for manual validation.
   - **Success Metric**: Either stabilize for CI or replace with reliable alternatives

### Medium Priority

3. **Performance Optimizations** (Informed by real usage)
   - Profile actual bottlenecks from dogfooding project
   - Optimize based on real performance data, not assumptions
   - May include deferred items from Version 0.6 if they prove important:
     - GUID string optimization
     - Transport chunked reading
     - Optimize tests (similar to Version 0.6, Slice 6d)

4. **API Enhancements** (Moved to Version 0.8)
   - FilePayload struct
   - BrowserContext options
   - Route continue overrides

## Version 1.0 Slices

### Slice 0: Single-Crate Architecture Consolidation (Completed in v0.7.0)

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETED**

**Note:** This work was completed as Version 0.7.0. See [v0.7 Release Notes](../roadmap.md) for details.

---

### Slice 1: Dogfooding & Validation

**Goal:** Complete integration of playwright-rust (v0.8+) into a real-world project (Project TBD), document pain points

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Select dogfooding project
- [ ] Document integration challenges
- [ ] Identify missing features or rough edges
- [ ] Create list of needed examples
- [ ] Performance profiling in real usage

**Progress:**
- [x] Resolved Issue #1: Headless mode control (Verified)
- [x] Resolved Issue #2: Browser.isConnected() (Implemented)
- [x] Resolved Issue #24: page.set_viewport_size() for responsive testing (Implemented)
- [x] Stabilized flaky tests (Deferred from Version 0.6) - `test_no_zombie_processes`, `test_process_cleanup`, `test_error_recovery_stress`

**Iterative Workflow:**
This slice follows a feedback loop with the dogfooding project:
1. **Identify**: Attempt to implement user stories in the project until a blocker/pain point is hit.
2. **Resolve**: Switch to `playwright-rust` to resolve the specific issue (e.g., missing feature, bug).
3. **Repeat**: Return to project and continue until the user story is complete.
4. **Finalize**: Once integration is stable, complete the remaining documentation and profiling tasks.

**Success Criteria:**
- Project successfully using playwright-rust in production
- Pain points documented and prioritized
- Performance baseline established

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **API Stability** - Which APIs to mark as stable vs experimental
2. **Performance Trade-offs** - Where to optimize vs maintain simplicity
3. **Feature Scope** - Which deferred features are actually needed
4. **Breaking Changes** - What changes justify a major version bump

## Technical Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Major bugs discovered in production | Delays v1.0.0 | Thorough testing in dogfooding project first |
| API changes needed | Breaking changes | Early validation, deprecation strategy |
| Performance issues | Poor user experience | Profile early and often |
| Platform-specific bugs | Limited adoption | Test on all platforms regularly |

## Notes

### Architectural Discovery

**Issue #3 Impact:** During initial real-world validation integration, we discovered that the build script in `playwright-core` couldn't correctly determine workspace root when used as a crates.io dependency. This revealed fundamental architectural complexity in the two-crate split.

**Decision Process:**
1. Fixed issue #3 in v0.6.1 with robust workspace detection (interim solution)
2. Analyzed root cause → two-crate split adds complexity without value
3. Researched all official Playwright implementations → ALL use single packages
4. Created ADR 0003 documenting analysis and decision
5. Integrated consolidation into Version 0.7 (Slice 0)

This is **exactly the type of discovery** Version 1.0 was designed for: real-world usage revealing architectural issues that theoretical planning missed.

### Implementation Approach

- **Trunk-based development:** Small, frequent commits directly to main
- **CI validation:** Every commit must pass full test suite
- **Real-world testing:** Validate in dogfooding project throughout process
- **No long-lived branches:** Changes integrated continuously

### Plan Evolution

- This plan evolved based on actual integration discoveries
- Slices may continue to evolve based on technical priorities
- Focus remains on solving real problems, not theoretical ones
