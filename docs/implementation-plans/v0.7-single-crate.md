# Version 0.7: Real-World Integration & Single Crate - Implementation Plan

**Status:** 🚧 **IN PROGRESS**

**Goal:** Consolidate architecture and implement critical features for real-world integration (Remote Connection, API Polish) to validate v1.0 readiness.

**Releases:**
- v0.7.0: Single Crate Architecture (2025-11-16)
- v0.7.1: Remote Connection (Planned)

**Related:**
- [Roadmap](../roadmap.md)
- [ADR 0003: Single Crate Architecture](../adr/0003-single-crate-architecture.md)

## Vertical Slices

### Slice 1: Consolidation (v0.7.0)

**Goal:** Merge `playwright-core` functionality into `playwright` and publish.

**Motivation:** Issue #3 discovered during Folio integration revealed fundamental complexity in two-crate split. All official Playwright implementations use single packages.

**Key Deliverables:**
- [x] Move `playwright-core` code into `playwright` crate
- [x] Update dependencies and build scripts
- [x] Verify all tests pass in single-crate structure
- [x] Publish `playwright-rs` v0.7.0
- [x] Publish `playwright-core` v0.6.2 with deprecation notice
- [x] Update documentation to reflect single-crate usage

**Technical Decisions:**
- Kept `playwright-core` as a shell for deprecation/redirect.
- Updated `driver` handling to be internal to the main crate.

### Slice 2: Remote Connection (v0.7.1)

**Status:** 🔴 **Not Started**

**Goal:** Implement `BrowserType::connect` for remote browser connection (critical for CI/CD).

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to connect to a remote Playwright browser (e.g., in Docker or BrowserStack) so I can run tests in CI/CD environments.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Define `ConnectOptions` struct (ws_endpoint, headers, slow_mo, timeout)
- [ ] Implement `BrowserType::connect(url, options)`
- [ ] Implement `BrowserType::connect_over_cdp(url, options)` (optional)
- [ ] Verify `Transport` WebSocket support (add tungstenite dependency)
- [ ] Add integration tests (launch server separately, connect to it)

---

### Slice 3: Critical Feature Gaps (v0.7.2)

**Status:** 🔴 **Not Started**

**Goal:** Address critical missing features and stability issues identified in the gap analysis.

**Tasks:**
- [ ] **[CRITICAL]** Audit `Locator` API (specifically `select_option`, `set_input_files`)
- [ ] Implement `WebSocket` event handling (`on_websocket`)

### Slice 4: API Polish & DX (v0.7.3)

**Status:** 🟡 **Partially Complete**

**Goal:** Improve developer experience and API completeness before v1.0.

**Tasks:**
- [x] **Community Contribution:** `BrowserContext.add_init_script()` - Inject scripts before page load (PR #7 by @douglasob)
- [x] **Community Contribution:** `Page.add_init_script()` - Inject scripts before page load (PR #7 by @douglasob)
- [x] **Community Contribution:** `Page.add_style_tag()` - Inject CSS with full Playwright API compatibility (PR #7 by @douglasob)
- [ ] Implement `FilePayload` struct
- [ ] Add `BrowserContext` options
- [ ] Review `Route` API overrides
- [ ] Improve error messages based on Folio feedback

**Community Contributions:**
- **PR #7 (@douglasob):** Added script and style injection APIs
  - `add_init_script()` for BrowserContext and Page
  - `add_style_tag()` with AddStyleTagOptions (content, url, path support)
  - Comprehensive test coverage including cross-browser tests
  - Refactored to match Playwright API specification exactly
